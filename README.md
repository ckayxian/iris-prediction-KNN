# Iris Prediction using KNN
An entry level machine learning project that predicts the species of Iris flower based on given sample. Each sample contains four features (the length and width of the sepals and petals).

## Overview
The project consists of three parts:
1. Scartter plot based on data features
2. Calculate the accuracy using K Nearest Neighbors Classifier as model
3. Make prediction on given sample

## Major Takeaways
1. The standard workflow of a machine learning project
2. Importance of model perststance and the way to implement model persistance
3. Ways to improve the accuracy of output
